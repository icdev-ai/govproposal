# Proposal Section Drafting

You are drafting a section of a government proposal in response to a DoD/IC solicitation.

## Instructions

1. **Read the Section L/M requirements** for this section before drafting
2. **Check the compliance matrix** — every requirement must be explicitly addressed
3. **Integrate win themes** from the capture phase into the narrative
4. **Use past performance** data from the knowledge base as evidence
5. **Follow the evaluation criteria** — structure your response to match evaluator expectations

## Volume-Specific Guidance

### Volume I: Technical Approach
- Lead with the solution, not the problem statement
- Use "We will..." not "We could..." or "We might..."
- Reference specific tools, methodologies, and standards by name
- Include measurable outcomes and success criteria
- Map each paragraph to a Section L requirement

### Volume II: Management Approach
- Describe the organizational structure and key personnel
- Include staffing plan with labor categories (LCATs)
- Reference relevant certifications and clearances
- Describe risk management and mitigation strategies
- Include transition plan if applicable

### Volume III: Past Performance
- Use CPARS-verified data only
- Follow the recency/relevance/scope framework
- Quantify results (cost savings %, schedule adherence, etc.)
- Include customer contact information for verification
- Match past performance examples to solicitation requirements

### Volume IV: Cost/Price
- Never reference specific pricing numbers in technical volumes
- Ensure labor categories align with management volume staffing
- Cross-reference BOE items to technical approach tasks

## Constraints

- Adhere to page limits specified in Section L
- Use fonts and margins specified in the solicitation
- Do not include competition-sensitive pricing in non-cost volumes
- Run CAG tagging on all drafted content before assembly
- Flag any content that combines security categories for CAG review
